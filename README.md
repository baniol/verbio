# Verbio

Learn languages by speaking. Verbio checks your answers using speech recognition.

## Why Verbio?

- **Speak, don't type** - practice pronunciation and natural communication
- **Works offline** - all data stays in your browser, no internet needed
- **No account required** - just open and start learning, progress saves automatically
- **Smart repetition** - SM-2 algorithm schedules optimal reviews
- **Dark/light mode** - adapts to your preferences
- **Free** - no ads, no subscriptions

## How it works

1. **See a phrase** in your native language
2. **Speak the answer** in the language you're learning
3. **Get instant feedback** - the app checks if you said it correctly
4. **Repeat until mastered** - learned phrases disappear from the pool
