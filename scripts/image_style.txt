Simple black ink brush stroke drawing. Thick expressive lines, minimal details, loose hand-drawn feel. White or light gray background. No shading, no colors except maybe one accent color. Focus on the key object of the scene. Like a quick sketch. Character must be shown from head to feet, nothing cropped, leave margin around figure.

Scene: Standing person with simple friendly face, short hair, holding up a puffy winter jacket and looking at it. Whole body visible including feet.
